<h1>GoToShow</h1>

GoToShow is a platform for crowdsourced concert information. For live music lovers, it's often inconvenient to find out what shows are happening in a given weekend and at which venues, without visiting a ton of websites independently. GoToShow removes the hassle by letting concertgoers, bands, or even venues add upcoming shows to the site, putting it all conveniently in one place.

<h2>Basic Site Info</h2>
The frontend of the site was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with EJS parsing show data onto the webpages and allowing for the use of JS alongside the html. The backend uses Node.js, Mongoose, and Express, with our data stored in MongoDB Atlas and the web-based version of the application hosted on Heroku. Bcrypt and express-session are used for user/password and session functionality.
